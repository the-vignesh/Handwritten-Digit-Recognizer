# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This is a small project I made to learn CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).  
It uses the MNIST dataset and predicts digits from 0â€“9.

## What I did
- Loaded MNIST dataset
- Built a simple CNN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained it for 5 epochs
- Plotted accuracy graph
